3546. Equal Sum Grid Partition I

Attempted   Medium  Companies   Hint

You are given an m x n matrix grid of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

    Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
    The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.

Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: true

Explanation:

A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Output: false

Explanation:

No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is false.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= m == grid.length <= 105
    1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105
    2 <= m * n <= 105
    1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

Hint 1
There are two types of cuts: a horizontal cut or a vertical cut.
Hint 2
For a horizontal cut at row r (0 <= r grid into rows 0...r vs. r+1...m-1 and compare their sums.
Hint 3
For a vertical cut at column c (0 <= c < n - 1), split grid into columns 0...c vs. c+1...n-1 and compare their sums.
Hint 4
Bruteâ€‘force all possible r and c cuts; if any yields equal section sums, return true.
