Solved  Easy    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
