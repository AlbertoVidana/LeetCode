3333. Find the Original Typed String II

Solved  Hard    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and "abbccdd".

Example 2:

Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 8

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "aabbccdd".

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabbb", k = 3

Output: 8

 

Constraints:

    1 <= word.length <= 5 * 105
    word consists only of lowercase English letters.
    1 <= k <= 2000
