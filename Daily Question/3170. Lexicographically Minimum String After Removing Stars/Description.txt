Solved  Medium  Topics premium lock iconCompanies

You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.

While there is a '*', do the following operation:

    Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.

Return the

resulting string after removing all '*' characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaba*"

Output: "aab"

Explanation:

We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no '*' in the string.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s consists only of lowercase English letters and '*'.
    The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all '*' characters.
