3721. Longest Balanced Subarray II

Solved  Hard    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

You are given an integer array nums.

A is called balanced if the number of distinct even numbers in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct odd numbers.

Return the length of the longest balanced subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,4,3]

Output: 4

Explanation:

    The longest balanced subarray is [2, 5, 4, 3].
    It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [5, 3]. Thus, the answer is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,5,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

    The longest balanced subarray is [3, 2, 2, 5, 4].
    It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [3, 5]. Thus, the answer is 5.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:

    The longest balanced subarray is [2, 3, 2].
    It has 1 distinct even number [2] and 1 distinct odd number [3]. Thus, the answer is 3.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 105

Hint 1
Store the first (or all) occurrences for each value in pos[val].
Hint 2
Build a lazy segment tree over start indices l in [0..n-1] that supports range add and can tell if any index has value 0 (keep mn/mx).
Hint 3
Use sign = +1 for odd values and sign = -1 for even values.
Hint 4
Initialize by adding each value's contribution with update(p, n-1, sign) where p is its current first occurrence.
Hint 5
Slide left l: pop pos[nums[l]], let next = next occurrence or n, do update(0, next-1, -sign), then query for any r >= l with value 0 and update ans = max(ans, r-l+1).
