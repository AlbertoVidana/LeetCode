2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City

Solved  Hard    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

    Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.

 

Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

Example 2:

Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: 
It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.

 

Constraints:

    n == stations.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    0 <= stations[i] <= 105
    0 <= r <= n - 1
    0 <= k <= 109
