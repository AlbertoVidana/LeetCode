2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I

Solved  Easy    Topics  Companies   Hint

You are given a string array words and a binary array groups both of length n.

A

of words is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements at the same indices in groups are different (that is, there cannot be consecutive 0 or 1).

Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence from words.

Return the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note: The elements in words are distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]

Output: ["e","b"]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is ["e","b"] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is ["a","b"] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,0,1,1]

Output: ["a","b","c"]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is ["a","b","c"] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is ["a","b","d"] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[3]. It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 3.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 100
    1 <= words[i].length <= 10
    groups[i] is either 0 or 1.
    words consists of distinct strings.
    words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

Hint 1
This problem can be solved greedily.
Hint 2
Begin by constructing the answer starting with the first number in groups.
Hint 3
For each index i in the range [1, n - 1], add i to the answer if groups[i] != groups[i - 1].
