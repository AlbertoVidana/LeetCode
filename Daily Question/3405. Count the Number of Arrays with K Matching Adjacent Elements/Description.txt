3405. Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements

Solved      Hard    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

You are given three integers n, m, k. A good array arr of size n is defined as follows:

    Each element in arr is in the inclusive range [1, m].
    Exactly k indices i (where 1 <= i < n) satisfy the condition arr[i - 1] == arr[i].

Return the number of good arrays that can be formed.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, m = 2, k = 1

Output: 4

Explanation:

    There are 4 good arrays. They are [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 1].
    Hence, the answer is 4.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, m = 2, k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

    The good arrays are [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 2, 1].
    Hence, the answer is 6.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, m = 2, k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

    The good arrays are [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Hence, the answer is 2.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= m <= 105
    0 <= k <= n - 1

Hint 1
The first position arr[0] has m choices.
Hint 2
For each of the remaining n - 1 indices, 0 < i < n, select k positions from left to right and set arr[i] = arr[i - 1].
Hint 3
For all other indices, set arr[i] != arr[i - 1] with (m - 1) choices for each of the n - 1 - k positions.
