717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

Solved  Easy    Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

We have two special characters:

    The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
    The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

 

Example 1:

Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.

Example 2:

Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= bits.length <= 1000
    bits[i] is either 0 or 1.

Hint 1
Keep track of where the next character starts. At the end, you want to know if you started on the last bit.
