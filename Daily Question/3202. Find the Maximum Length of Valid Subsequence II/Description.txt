3202. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence II

Solved  Medium  Topics  premium lock iconCompanies  Hint

You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.

A

sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:

    (sub[0] + sub[1]) % k == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % k == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % k.

Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output: 5

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,3,1,4], k = 3

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest valid subsequence is [1, 4, 1, 4].

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 103
    1 <= nums[i] <= 107
    1 <= k <= 103

Hint 1
Fix the value of (subs[0] + subs[1]) % k from the k possible values. Let it be val.
Hint 2
Let dp[i] store the maximum length of a subsequence with its last element x such that x % k == i.
Hint 3
Answer for a subsequence ending at index y is dp[(k + val - (y % k)) % k] + 1.
