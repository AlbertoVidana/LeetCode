3392. Count Subarrays of Length Three With a Condition

Solved  Easy    Topics  Companies   Hint

Given an integer array nums, return the number of

of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,4,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only the subarray [1,4,1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

[1,1,1] is the only subarray of length 3. However, its first and third numbers do not add to half the middle number.

 

Constraints:

    3 <= nums.length <= 100
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
